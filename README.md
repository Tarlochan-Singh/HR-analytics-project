In order to create a comprehensive dashboard for HR at ATLIQ that focuses on employee attendance analytics, this project makes use of Power BI. Real-time insights into attendance patterns, such as rates, trends, and anomalies, are available through the dashboard. It makes it simple for HR professionals to evaluate and interpret the data by providing a visual representation of attendance data, such as interactive charts and graphs. HR can obtain deeper insights into attendance metrics with the dashboard's features for filtering and drilling down into particular data sets. The overall goal of this project is to improve HR's capacity to effectively track and manage employee attendance, which will ultimately lead to increased productivity and organizational efficiency.
